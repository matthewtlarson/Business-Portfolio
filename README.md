# module-2-challenge
First I created a header as well as a nav bar;
Then I linked them to corresponding sections below;
After the header I put a background image of myself;
Then an about me section;
Following that I included a work section along with a external link connected to the image;
Finally I added a "contact me" section;
I made external links for each list item;
